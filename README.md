# FoodTruckProject

Objective

This program allows a user to input data about foods truck to include name, food type, and a rating for up to five trucks. In the background will be an automatic counter to apply id's to each truck. After entering five trucks, the program will quit. At anytime, the user can also enter "quit" to end the program. 

Upon completion of input, the user will see a menu and can choose to list all existing food trucks, see the average rating of each food truck, display the highest rated food truck, or quit the program. 


# Experience Writing The Code

This was extremely difficult for me. I was able to complete the encapsulation part, but could not figure out how to complete the add itself beyond the initial data inputs.
